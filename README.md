Dude, so I finally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Inception. Man, what a trip. Like, seriously, my brain is still buffering. Have you seen it? It's like this wild dream loop within a loop within another COFFEE-NEEDED kind of loop! At one point, I just lost track of what's a dream and what's reality. Pretty sure that's what they want, though. Sneaky Christoper Nolan, I see you.

> You know those spinning top memes? They're everywhere, right? Now that I've seen it, I get it. But like, did you think the top was gonna fall at the end? Damn cliffhanger, now I can't sleep—thanks, Nolan. 😂 I mean, I was just trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for a chill evening, but now I can't shut my brain off.

And what's up with the kick? That 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 fall thing got me thinking, maybe I could use a kick to get out of bed every morning, no joke. Jumping from exploding dreams to icy fortresses, my head's still spinning. It's like dream parkour. 

There's that mind-bending soundtrack too. It's half the reason I think my heart's still racing. You know what I mean? Anyway, I should've expected this with the whole 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   crowd hyping it for ages. Now, I'm in that rabbit hole.

for(int i = 0; i < dreamLayers; i++) level++;

But seriously, what a ride! Gotta re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 to catch stuff I missed when my brain was off trying to figure out if I'm still dreaming. Next time, I'll take notes or something! 😂
